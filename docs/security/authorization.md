### **Authorization Hierarchy**
```
System Admin (ADMIN)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Full system access
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ User management
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ All exams access
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ System configuration

Regular User (USER)  
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Own profile management
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Own exams only
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Public exam access
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Limited upload permissions
```

## üé≠ ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL

### **User Roles**

**USER (Default Role):**
- ‚úÖ Create and manage own exams
- ‚úÖ Upload files for own use
- ‚úÖ Take public exams
- ‚úÖ View own exam results
- ‚ùå Cannot access other users' data
- ‚ùå Cannot perform admin functions

**ADMIN (Elevated Role):**
- ‚úÖ All USER permissions
- ‚úÖ View all users and exams
- ‚úÖ Manage system settings
- ‚úÖ Delete any content
- ‚úÖ Access system analytics
- ‚úÖ User account management

### **Role Implementation**
```python
# Current: Basic enum in user model
class UserRole(str, enum.Enum):
    USER = "user"
    ADMIN = "admin"

# TODO: Extended role system with permissions
class Permission(str, enum.Enum):
    READ_OWN_EXAMS = "read:own_exams"
    WRITE_OWN_EXAMS = "write:own_exams"
    READ_ALL_EXAMS = "read:all_exams"
    DELETE_ANY_EXAM = "delete:any_exam"
    MANAGE_USERS = "manage:users"
```

## üîí RESOURCE OWNERSHIP

### **Ownership Model**

**Exam Ownership:**
- Creator has full CRUD access
- Public exams readable by all authenticated users
- Private exams accessible only by creator

**File Ownership:**
- Uploader has full access (read, delete)
- Files are user-scoped by default
- No sharing mechanism (yet)

**Attempt Ownership:**
- Users can only view their own exam attempts
- Exam creators can view attempts on their exams

### **Ownership Validation (TODO)**
```python
# Example implementation needed
async def check_exam_ownership(exam_id: str, user_id: str) -> bool:
    """Check if user owns or can access exam"""
    exam = await exam_repository.get_by_id(exam_id)
    if not exam:
        return False
    
    # Owner access
    if exam.creator_id == user_id:
        return True
    
    # Public exam access
    if exam.is_public:
        return True
        
    return False
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CURRENT AUTHORIZATION STATUS

### **üö® CRITICAL SECURITY GAPS**

**No Authorization Middleware:**
- All endpoints currently public
- No role checking implemented
- No ownership validation
- Admin functions accessible to all

**Missing Permission Checks:**
- Users can access any exam by ID
- File uploads not user-scoped
- No resource ownership validation
- Admin endpoints don't exist yet

**No Access Control:**
- Database queries don't filter by user
- No user-scoped data access
- Cross-user data exposure possible

---

## üéØ IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### **Phase 1: Basic Authorization (CRITICAL)**

**1. Role-Based Route Protection:**
```python
# TODO: Implement role checker
async def require_role(required_role: UserRole):
    def role_checker(current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)):
        if current_user.role != required_role:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=403,
                detail="Insufficient permissions"
            )
        return current_user
    return role_checker

# Usage in endpoints
@router.get("/admin/users")
async def list_users(
    admin_user: User = Depends(require_role(UserRole.ADMIN))
):
    # Only admins can access
    pass
```

**2. Resource Ownership Validation:**
```python
# TODO: Implement ownership checker
async def check_exam_access(
    exam_id: str,
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user),
    db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db_session)
):
    exam_service = ExamService(db)
    exam = await exam_service.get_exam_by_id(exam_id)
    
    if not exam:
        raise HTTPException(404, "Exam not found")
    
    # Check ownership or public access
    if exam.creator_id != current_user.id and not exam.is_public:
        raise HTTPException(403, "Access denied")
    
    return exam

# Usage in endpoints
@router.get("/exam/{exam_id}")
async def get_exam(
    exam: dict = Depends(check_exam_access)
):
    return exam
```

### **Phase 2: Advanced Authorization**

**3. Permission-Based System:**
```python
# TODO: Permission decorator
def require_permission(permission: str):
    def permission_checker(current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)):
        user_permissions = get_user_permissions(current_user.role)
        if permission not in user_permissions:
            raise HTTPException(403, "Permission denied")
        return current_user
    return permission_checker
```

**4. User-Scoped Queries:**
```python
# TODO: Update repositories to filter by user
async def list_user_exams(user_id: str) -> List[Exam]:
    """Get only exams owned by user"""
    return await exam_repository.get_by_creator(user_id)

async def list_accessible_exams(user_id: str) -> List[Exam]:
    """Get exams user can access (owned + public)"""
    owned = await exam_repository.get_by_creator(user_id)
    public = await exam_repository.get_public_exams()
    return owned + public
```

## üîê ENDPOINT PROTECTION MATRIX

### **Current Status (ALL PUBLIC ‚ö†Ô∏è)**

| Endpoint | Current | Should Be | Authorization |
|----------|---------|-----------|---------------|
| `POST /auth/*` | Public ‚úÖ | Public ‚úÖ | None |
| `GET /health` | Public ‚úÖ | Public ‚úÖ | None |
| `POST /exam/generate` | Public ‚ùå | Auth Required | User+ |
| `POST /exam/save` | Public ‚ùå | Auth Required | User+ |
| `GET /exam/{id}` | Public ‚ùå | Auth + Ownership | Owner/Public |
| `POST /upload/upload` | Public ‚ùå | Auth Required | User+ |
| `GET /upload/{id}` | Public ‚ùå | Auth + Ownership | Owner Only |
| `DELETE /upload/{id}` | Public ‚ùå | Auth + Ownership | Owner Only |

### **Planned Admin Endpoints**

| Endpoint | Authorization | Description |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `GET /admin/users` | Admin Only | List all users |
| `GET /admin/exams` | Admin Only | List all exams |
| `DELETE /admin/user/{id}` | Admin Only | Delete user |
| `PUT /admin/user/{id}/role` | Admin Only | Change user role |
| `GET /admin/analytics` | Admin Only | System stats |

## üß™ AUTHORIZATION TESTING

### **Test Scenarios (TODO)**

**Role-Based Tests:**
```python
def test_user_cannot_access_admin_endpoints():
    # Regular user tries admin endpoint
    # Should return 403 Forbidden
    pass

def test_admin_can_access_all_endpoints():
    # Admin user accesses all endpoints
    # Should return 200 OK
    pass
```

**Ownership Tests:**
```python
def test_user_cannot_access_others_exams():
    # User A tries to access User B's private exam
    # Should return 403 Forbidden
    pass

def test_user_can_access_public_exams():
    # User A accesses User B's public exam
    # Should return 200 OK
    pass

def test_user_can_access_own_exams():
    # User accesses their own private exam
    # Should return 200 OK
    pass
```

## üéØ IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITIES

### **Immediate (Critical Security)**
1. **Protect exam endpoints** - Require authentication
2. **Protect upload endpoints** - User-scoped access
3. **Add ownership validation** - Check exam access rights
4. **Implement role checker** - Basic RBAC

### **High Priority**
1. **User-scoped database queries** - Filter data by user
2. **Admin role enforcement** - Protect admin functions
3. **Resource ownership validation** - Comprehensive checks
4. **Permission system foundation** - Extensible authorization

### **Medium Priority**
1. **Advanced permissions** - Granular access control
2. **Audit logging** - Track authorization decisions
3. **Rate limiting** - Prevent abuse
4. **Session management** - Multi-device authorization

## üîß CONFIGURATION

### **Authorization Settings**
```python
# TODO: Add to settings
class Settings:
    # Authorization
    enable_rbac: bool = True
    default_user_role: str = "user"
    admin_email_domains: List[str] = []  # Auto-admin for certain domains
    
    # Permissions
    allow_public_exam_creation: bool = True
    max_exams_per_user: int = 100
    max_upload_size_per_user: int = 100 * 1024 * 1024  # 100MB
```

### **Role Configuration**
```python
# TODO: Configurable role permissions
ROLE_PERMISSIONS = {
    "user": [
        "read:own_profile",
        "write:own_profile", 
        "create:own_exams",
        "read:own_exams",
        "write:own_exams",
        "delete:own_exams",
        "read:public_exams",
        "upload:own_files"
    ],
    "admin": [
        "*"  # All permissions
    ]
}
```

## üö® SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

### **Authorization Bypass Prevention**
- ‚úÖ Always validate user identity before authorization
- ‚úÖ Check permissions at API layer, not just frontend
- ‚úÖ Use database-level constraints where possible
- ‚úÖ Log all authorization decisions
- ‚úÖ Fail securely (deny by default)

### **Common Authorization Vulnerabilities**
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** User can access others' data by changing IDs
- **Missing Function Level Access Control:** Admin functions accessible to regular users
- **Privilege Escalation:** Users can elevate their own permissions
- **Session Fixation:** Authorization tied to compromised sessions

### **Mitigation Strategies**
- **Input Validation:** Validate all user inputs
- **Output Filtering:** Filter data based on user permissions
- **Least Privilege:** Grant minimum necessary permissions
- **Defense in Depth:** Multiple layers of authorization
- **Regular Audits:** Review and test authorization logic
